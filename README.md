##service.flatcheckbox.jquery - Styleable checkbox

###Description

service.flatcheckbox.jquery is a small jQuery plugin that serves 2 purposes:

- It styles a checkbox any way you want by hiding the `<input type="checbox" />` and  replacing it with a styled div. The css file that comes with the component creates a 'flat' checkbox (comparable with how you see checkboxes on Windows 8.x apps). 
- It binds your event handler to the element.

Although with CSS3 it is possible to re-style the default checkbox without using javascript I am not a fan of that solution because it still isn't supported across all browsers and, more importantly, you will anyhow need javascript to hook up an event handler.
